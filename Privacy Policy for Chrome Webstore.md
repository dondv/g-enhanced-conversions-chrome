# Privacy Policy for AdNetwork Parameter Detector



### 1. Network Request Monitoring
The AdNetwork Parameter Detector monitors network requests made by your browser to specific domains (`google.com` and `googleadservices.com`). This monitoring is limited to identifying requests that contain the `em` parameter with a specific prefix (`"tv.1~em"`).

### 2. Local Data Storage
The extension stores information about detected network requests locally within your browser. This includes:
- The URL of the detected request.
- The value of the `em` parameter if detected.
- The timestamp of when the request was detected.

No personal data or identifiable information is collected or stored by the extension.

### 3. User Settings
Any preferences or settings you configure within the extension are stored locally in your browser. These settings are not transmitted or shared with any external servers.

## How We Use Your Information

### 1. Enhance User Awareness
The primary purpose of collecting the above-mentioned data is to provide you with real-time feedback about the network requests made by your browser. This helps enhance your awareness of data transmission, especially when it comes to tracking parameters.

### 2. Display in Extension Interface
The detected network requests and their details (such as the `em` parameter) are displayed in the extension’s popup window and Chrome DevTools interface, giving you direct visibility into the relevant requests.

### 3. No External Data Transmission
The AdNetwork Parameter Detector does not transmit any data outside of your local browser. All processing and storage of information happen locally on your device.

## Data Security

We are committed to protecting your data. Since all data is stored locally in your browser, the security of this data largely depends on the security of your browser and device. We recommend keeping your browser and any related software up to date to maintain the highest security standards.

## Data Sharing and Disclosure

### 1. No Third-Party Access
The AdNetwork Parameter Detector does not share your data with any third parties. All data remains private and confined to your local environment.

### 2. Compliance with Laws
We may disclose your information if required by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities (e.g., a court or a government agency).

## Your Choices

### 1. Managing Stored Data
You can clear the data stored by the AdNetwork Parameter Detector at any time by resetting the extension or clearing your browser’s local storage.

### 2. Uninstalling the Extension
